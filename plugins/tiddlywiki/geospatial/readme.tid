title: $:/plugins/tiddlywiki/geospatial/readme

This is an early version of the new Geospatial Plugin for TiddlyWiki.

The goal is to add new primitives to the TiddlyWiki platform that enable non-developers to build sophisticated interactive geospatial applications.

The Geospatial Plugin incorporates a number of third party libraries and online services:

* Integrating the open source [[Leaflet.js|https://leafletjs.com/]] library to display interactive maps
* Integrating the open source [[Turf.js|https://turfjs.org/]] library to perform geospatial calculations with [[GeoJSON|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoJSON]] objects
* Integrating the commercial API [[TravelTime|https://traveltime.com/]] for [[geocoding|https://traveltime.com/features/geocoding]], [[routing|https://traveltime.com/features/multi-modal-routing]] and [[isochrones|https://traveltime.com/features/isochrones]]
* Integrating the free API from [[Flickr|https://www.flickr.com/services/api/]] for retrieving geotagged photographs
* Integrating Google's open source [[OpenLocationCode|https://github.com/google/open-location-code]] library for converting to and from Open Location Codes (also known as [[PlusCodes|https://maps.google.com/pluscodes/]])
